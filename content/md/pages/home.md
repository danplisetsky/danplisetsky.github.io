I'm Daniel Plisetsky, a software engineer and occasional writer. 

Most recently, I've worked with [General Motors][] on large-scale fleet management software.

I'm partial to functional programming, especially with Clojure.

I've also written a few things that have been published.
Head over to [publications][] to check them out (being able to read Russian will come in handy).
