My application was approved in November of last year, and I was given until September of this year to land in Toronto (though I'm not waiting until September to do so). I won't get into the nitty-gritty of the whole process since it's already been faithfully covered by Harry Schwartz (in English) and Julia "Julik" (in Russian). I will, however, give a general overview and cover some of the aspects unique to immigrating to Canada from Israel.How long did it take?</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><guid>https://danplisetsky.github.io/posts/2020-02-03-on-choosing-a-language/</guid><link>https://danplisetsky.github.io/posts/2020-02-03-on-choosing-a-language/</link><title>On Choosing a Language for my Next Project</title><description>I looked at Java, but it turned out to be coffee, so I drank it to not feel antsy.I looked at Python, but it turned out to be a snake, so I froze and didn't make a peep.  </description><pubDate>Mon, 03 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
