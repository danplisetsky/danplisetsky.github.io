I looked at Java,  
but it turned out to be coffee,  
so I drank it to not feel antsy.

I looked at Python,  
but it turned out to be a snake,  
so I froze and didn't make a peep.  
 
I looked at Ruby,  
but it turned out to be a gem,  
so I gave it to the woman I love.  
  
I looked at **C**,  
but it turned out to be a letter,  
so I saved it for later. 

I looked at Elixir,  
but it was a tad too general <sup>1</sup>,  
so it didn't make me beam with confidence.  

I looked at Reason,  
but it turned out to be an epistemological approach,   
so I embraced it. 
  
I looked at Swift, but it turned out to be an adjective.  
I looked at Groovy — ditto.  
I looked at Smalltalk, but I’m just so bad at it.   
  
I looked at Java again,  
but this time it was an island,  
and I didn't want to get stranded.
 
I looked at Julia,  
but Julia didn't look back at me.  

I looked at **R**,  
but it gave me pangs of déjà vu,  
and I felt dizzy.  
  
I looked at Elm...  
I looked at Rust...    
I looked at Go...  
  
But then I looked at **C**loju**r**e —  
And then I stopped looking.
